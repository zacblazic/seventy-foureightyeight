# Site & List Content Types

## Site Content Type

You create and manage content types at the site level. When you create a new content type and add it to a site's collection of content types, it becomes what is known as a site content type. At this point, the content type is available to add to lists and document libraries but has not yet been added.

## List Content Type

When you do add a site content type to a list, a local copy (instance) of the site content type is created and added to the list. This local instance is called a list content type and applies only to the list onto which it was copied.
